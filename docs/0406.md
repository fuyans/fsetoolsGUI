# Worked example

A building which had been built in two era with different external façade protection areas as shown below. The building is provided with compartmentation floors at each level (floor to ceiling height is 3.0 m).

The objective is to assess that whether the separation distances between the building in question and adjacent buildings are adequate to prevent external fire spread.

The façade can be split into 6 parts based on their orientation and unprotected area, see table below.

| Name     | Point 1      | Point 2      | Height | Heat flux [kW/m2] |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------ | ----------------- |
| Façade 1 | -0.68, 27.38 | 19.5, 27.38  | 3.0    | 84 x 40%          |
